This directory contains various demos:

*****************
** minimal.xml **
*****************

This is the minimal demo: see how easy it is to create an EditableGrid.
Only 3 lines of Javascript code, some minimal inline CSS, and here you go!
In this demo, the grid structure and data are obtained from an XML file. 
Of course, you don't have to write this file by hand...

********************
** minimal.attach **
********************

This is the exact same demo, but this time the grid structure and data are declared in the HTML file.
Extra column information (mainly the data type) are given using Javascript.

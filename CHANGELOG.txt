[21/10/2009] EditableGrid v1.0.0
================================

First stable public release, including the following main features:
- load grid from an XML file or attach to an existing HTML table
- edit cells with a suitable editor (string, integer, double, boolean, email, date)
- built-in renderers for dates, emails and numbers
- built-in validators for numeric values, emails and dates
- possibility to plug your own cell renderers, editors and validators 
- possibility to declare a list of possible values for each column (static in XML, or dynamic in Javascript)
- sort columns accordingly to their types, by clicking on the header

This release has been successfully tested on: Firefox 3.0 and 3.5, Internet Explorer 7 and 8, Safari 4, Google Chrome

[23/10/2009] EditableGrid v1.0.1
================================

Changed the XML loading method on Firefox: we use XMLHttpRequest which seems more stable than document.implementation.

[02/11/2009] EditableGrid v1.0.2
================================

Bug fixed: if you edited a cell then went to another tab in Firefox, the previous value was put back into the cell.

Several editable grids can now safely be put on the same page:
- you have to give a name when creating the EditableGrid instance (this name is used to prefix the row ids in the DOM in order to keep them unique)
- to retrieve the row id in database (ie. the row id you gave in your XML or HTML grid definition) you have to use the new method "getRowId"
